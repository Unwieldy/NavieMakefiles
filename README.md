# Naive Makefile implementation

This repository includes three Makefile projects.
Try them out!
Try:
* Changing things.
* Adding additional files.
* Chainging the file structure, eg. moving source files to folder called src.
    * What happends? Can you modify the Makefile to allow the project to be compiled?
* Compare the different implementations.
* Write your own implementation!
